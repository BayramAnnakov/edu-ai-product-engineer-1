**Review Text:** The latest update made this app useless. Downloaded files come up with the error "There is a problem with this video file (101.1.8)" It does this for every show. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app. Redownloaded some new shows and it still has this issue. If it's not fixed soon im going to have to cancel my account. This WAS a pretty good app. But this error makes it impissible to use. edit: 3 months later and I am still getting the same error. Tech support is zero help.

Not only can I download my favourite TV shows and movies and be able to watch them any where at anytime (with or without Wi-Fi) theres also so much content to choose from (some a little too much content to choose from üòÇ).

**Review Text:** Netflix has plenty of great shows and movies to watch, but lately the app has been giving me a lot of issues. Primarily, shows will just disappear from my "continue watching" list and it won't show up when I search for it. If I access Netflix from my PC, the show will still be there, but not on the mobile app. Nothing seems to fix the problem, but the show does eventually reappear after a few hours/ days. It's a really frustrating problem that I hope will be fixed ASAP.

**Classification Type:** bug report

**Classification Reasoning:** The user describes a bug in the Netflix mobile app where shows disappear from the ‚Äúcontinue watching‚Äù list and cannot be found via search on mobile, though they remain available on the PC version. The issue resolves itself after hours or days but recurs, causing frustration.

### Review 5
**Author Name:** A Google user

**Review Timestamp:** 2019-06-01 05:03:14

**Review Text:** My only complaints are that there aren't enough shows/movies, especially old movies, to choose from, and shows/movies I want to watch disappear. Otherwise, it's a great app that I use daily for a reasonable monthly price. We don't even use our TV anymore, except to play video games on it, and to watch an occasional movie on DVD. TV shows and movies we take anywhere with us and use on our phones or other connected devices. Who needs an expensive cable or dish bill when you have Netflix?

**Classification Type:** feature requests

**Classification Reasoning:** The user is asking for more shows and movies‚Äîespecially older films‚Äîand for titles they want to watch not to disappear, which is a request to expand and stabilize the content library.

**Review Text:** Netflix, the streaming giant, has revolutionized the way we consume entertainment. With an extensive library of movies, TV shows, and original content, it offers something for everyone. The user-friendly interface and personalized recommendations make it a joy to navigate. Binge-watching has never been easier, thanks to seamless playback and offline viewing options. While the continuous expansion of original content keeps subscribers engaged, occasional content fluctuations can be a downside.

**Classification Type:** other

**Classification Reasoning:** This is a general review of Netflix, praising its extensive library, interface, recommendations, playback features, and original content, while noting occasional content fluctuations as a downside.

**Review Timestamp:** 2022-04-13 13:48:12

**Review Text:** I've been using this app for years but lately, rather, somehow, the way the movies are displayed or shown changed and it's VERY annoying. It says it's not available when in fact I was just watching it on my computer minutes ago. And please return the "Continue watching for..." tab. It's really time consuming for anyone to scroll through the list of series/seasons and then fast fwd to the scene where you left off.

**Classification Type:** feature requests

**Classification Reasoning:** The user specifically asks for the return of the ‚ÄúContinue watching for‚Ä¶‚Äù tab, explaining that without it they must scroll through series and manually fast-forward to where they left off. This is a direct request to restore a removed feature.

**Review Timestamp:** 2021-08-05 23:57:31

**Review Text:** why do the subtitles automatically come on, when playing every movie? I'm, watching in English, yet the words are displayed across the screen in English, i do not need that. Why is there no option to choose your preference (to turn it off permanently ) so this does not happen on every single movie. It is inconvient and distracting when you have to wait until the movie starts and then turn off sub titles. what are you people doing with your updates? This is unenjoyable.

**Classification Type:** feature requests

**Classification Reasoning:** The user is asking for a feature: a permanent setting to disable subtitles so they don‚Äôt automatically appear on every movie. They‚Äôre requesting an option to choose subtitle preferences once and have it apply to all future playback.

**Review Text:** Netflix is just awesome. I mean who wouldn't think that, it has got great content, streaming quality and more. But I give it 4 stars because while watching a movie the controls sometimes automatically get locked and it doesn't even show how to unlock it. Even the closing it and starting it again technique doesn't work , so that can really annoying when you are in middle of a nice movie.

**Classification Type:** bug report

**Review Text:** It would be great if you will include the full seasons per series. Best example is Grey's Anatomy. I don't understand why put season 1 and 2 then skip to season 13 to 15. Hope you'll do something about this.

**Review Text:** Serious issue with Netflix last 3 days. After latest update my app gets stuck whenever I open it. I can only see a screen with Netflix written on it. I've tried to reinstall , update multiple times but it doesn't fix the issue. Please check if the application is properly working as a mobile application. Facing this issue for the very first time.

**Review Text:** I really love the app! There are a lot of good shows and movies I have watched recently and I enjoy watching them! However, I am experiencing an issue during playback on my devices.

### Review 14
**Author Name:** Er******tz

**Review Timestamp:** 2022-04-08 23:40:37

**Review Text:** Love Netflix and the ability to stream on my phone. Recently that has changed. For some reason now the screen darkens so much that it is difficult to see anything unless I'm in a dark to completely dark room/area. And not just for shows/movies that have lower lighting already. I'm unable to adjust the screen brightness because the app controls that while in use. Tried updating but the issue persists.

**Classification Type:** bug report

**Classification Reasoning:** The user reports that the Netflix app is now dimming the screen excessively during playback‚Äîoverriding the phone‚Äôs native brightness controls‚Äîand making it difficult to view content unless in a dark environment. They attempted an app update but the problem remains.

### Review 15
**Author Name:** M****C

**Review Timestamp:** 2023-07-18 01:15:07

**Review Text:** The minute I switched the service to include ads, the service became shoddy. It WILL NOT play ads. This happens on two different devices. Netflix stops streaming when ads begin airing with some kind of buzzing just before it shuts down the device. I'm only playing it on one device at a time. Sometimes, it does this in the middle of the show being streamed. Get it fixed, dudes! This DOES NOT happen with other apps. So don't blame it on my devices.

**Classification Type:** bug report

**Classification Reasoning:** The user reports that after enabling ads, Netflix fails to play the ads and instead stops streaming and shuts down the device with a buzzing noise. This issue occurs on multiple devices and interrupts playback, indicating a bug in the ad playback functionality.
