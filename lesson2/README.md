  - Single-round question and answer format
  - Predefined product idea and hypotheses
  - Basic facilitator and customer agent interactions

### userboard2.py
- **Enhanced Implementation**: Builds on userboard1 with improved structure
- **Features**:
  - Multiple questions handled sequentially
  - Clearer output formatting
  - More organized conversation flow

### userboard3.py
- **Advanced Implementation**: Adds personalized follow-up questions
- **Features**:
  - Facilitator reviews each customer response
  - Dynamic follow-up questions based on individual responses
  - More realistic conversation simulation
  - Improved agent interactions
