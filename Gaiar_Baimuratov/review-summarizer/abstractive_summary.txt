The app garners a mix of positive and negative feedback in these reviews. Users appreciate the app for its simplicity, quality brand offerings, and consistent positive experiences over long-term use, with some noting it as a daily go-to for deals. Many find the communication prompt and helpful, adding to a satisfactory user experience. However, common criticisms highlight significant areas for improvement. The most frequent issues include the high shipping costs and the cumbersome returns process, which requires emailing for returns slips. Users are also disappointed by the lack of a search function, making navigation difficult. Additionally, some find the items lack value, with price fluctuations and premium sections containing non-premium products causing dissatisfaction. Another key concern is technical issues like disrupted cart functionality and login problems. Finally, users are wary of overseas transaction fees associated with payments, leading to increased costs. Addressing these issues could enhance user satisfaction significantly.
