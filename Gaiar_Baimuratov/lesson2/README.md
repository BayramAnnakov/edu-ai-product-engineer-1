# AI Product Research Interview Simulator

An interactive CLI tool that **simulates a multi–persona product‑market interview** powered by OpenAI models.  
It lets you quickly stress‑test a product idea, capture rich qualitative feedback and walk away with an *executive summary* and *sentiment analysis* – all in a single run.

---

## Features

* **Facilitated focus‑group** – an AI *facilitator* asks core and follow‑up questions.
* **Multiple personas** – configurable agents (e.g. *Alice – Athlete*, *Bob – Office Worker*) respond, react to each other and reference personal context.
* **Rich console output** – colour‑coded panels and tables powered by [`rich`](https://github.com/Textualize/rich).
* **Automatic analysis**  
  * Sentiment analysis for every persona.  
  * One‑click *GO / NO‑GO* decision and key rationale.

## Quick‑start

1. **Clone** the repository and `cd` into it:

   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd <repo>
   ```

2. **Install** the dependencies (Python ≥ 3.9):

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set your OpenAI key** (required by the `openai-agents` runtime):

   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...        # PowerShell: setx OPENAI_API_KEY "sk-..."
   ```

4. **Run** the interview:

   ```bash
   python userboard4-baimuratov.py
   ```

You will see colour‑coded dialogue followed by an executive summary report.

## Customising the session


### Configure personas via CSV

All personas now live in `personas.csv`. Add as many rows as you like – the script
will read the file at runtime and turn each row into a persona agent.

CSV schema (header row):

```text
name,age,role,context,goals,pain_points,tech_savvy,color,emoji
```

The *description* fed to the LLM is autogenerated by concatenating the columns
above, so keep the values short and meaningful.  
Set a different path via env var `PERSONAS_CSV` if you want to keep multiple
persona sets.

* `color`, `emoji` are optional – they control how the message panel looks in
  the console. If omitted the script will pick colours / emojis for you.

### Other knobs

Open `userboard4-baimuratov.py` and adjust:

```python
topic = "A subscription‑based smart water bottle that reminds users to drink."

core_qs = [
    "What is your initial reaction to the idea?",
    ...
]
```

* `topic` – product / concept you want to validate.
* `core_qs` – ordered list of must‑ask questions.
* `max_followups` – optional environment variable or argument (default **3**).
