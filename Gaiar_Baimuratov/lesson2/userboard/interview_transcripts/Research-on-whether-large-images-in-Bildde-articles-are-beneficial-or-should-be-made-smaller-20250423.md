# Interview Transcript: Research on whether large images in Bild.de articles are beneficial or should be made smaller

**Date:** 2025-04-23

**Decision: NO GO**

## Market Perspective

Large, eye‑catching images are widely valued across user segments for rapid comprehension and emotional pull. While all personas note occasional drawbacks—extra scrolling, slower loads—the consensus is to keep visuals prominent and merely optimize for speed and balance. A blanket reduction in image size risks eroding engagement, especially for entertainment, sports and product‑oriented content where pictures carry key context.

## Key Rationale

- Klaus relies on big images to grasp articles quickly during short breaks; shrinking them would reduce his ability to skim efficiently.
- Sabine says large celebrity photos are central to engagement and worries smaller images would "lessen the appeal."
- Thomas finds big sports photos essential for instant insight into goals and highlights; he wants faster loads, not smaller visuals.
- Monika uses large product shots to judge deals; too‑small images would hide critical details she needs to decide.
- Jürgen, though tech‑averse, still values large visuals for clarity on crime stories; he asks only for better speed, echoing others that balance—not downsizing—is "key."
- All personas cite load time issues, but none advocate drastic size cuts; they prefer optimization that preserves current visual impact.

Since I rely on my phone for news between shifts, clear visuals make it easier to get the gist of an article without reading every word. As a factory worker with limited time, this is really beneficial for staying informed efficiently.

**Sabine (Homemaker):** Do I think the image sizes on Bild.de are suitable?

I enjoy the large images because they catch my eye and make articles more engaging. For entertainment and celebrity gossip, visuals add context and excitement. I find smaller images might lessen the appeal, making it harder to get drawn in.

Listening to Klaus, I see his point about quick understanding. Though I have more time at home, I agree that images enhance the article's impact. For someone like me who loves entertainment, big visuals are a plus!

**Thomas (Sports fan):** Do I think the image sizes on Bild.de are suitable?

I find the current image sizes useful, especially for following sports stories. Large images make it easier to quickly grasp the highlights of a match or a player’s performance. When I'm checking transfer news or scores on the go, these visuals help catch important details instantly.

Listening to Klaus, I agree that clear visuals are crucial when time is tight. Sabine's point about engagement resonates too, as larger images do make the articles more appealing. As a sports fan wanting quick insights, the size of the images is beneficial.

**Monika (Bargain hunter):** Are the image sizes in Bild.de articles too large for my needs?

I find the current image sizes helpful. Large images highlight deals and product recommendations clearly, making it easier for me to assess an offer quickly. Being skeptical about online shopping, clear visuals help me feel more confident about what I’m considering.

I relate to Klaus and Thomas about the importance of clear visuals. While I’m not in a hurry, larger images help me examine product details better. Sabine’s point about engagement is true for me too; big images make article exploration more enjoyable.

**Jürgen (Traditional):** Do I think the current image sizes on Bild.de articles are effective?

I find the large images beneficial. They catch my attention and simplify understanding of stories about crime and immigration, which are my main interests. As someone who isn’t very tech-savvy, large visuals help me quickly grasp the article's essence without getting lost in details.

I agree with Klaus and Thomas on the importance of clear visuals for quick understanding, and Sabine’s point about increased engagement is also relevant. For someone like me who prefers straightforward reporting, the current image sizes work well.

**Facilitator:** How do large images impact your reading experience on news websites? Follow-up: Can you describe a specific example when a large image either helped you understand an article faster or perhaps distracted you from the text? Follow-up: Do you ever notice any drawbacks—like images pushing important content off-screen or slowing down your browsing—when images are very large?

**Klaus (Working class):** Large images can make articles more engaging but sometimes distract from the text.

For me, large images in sports articles can quickly highlight key moments, like a goal or a critical play, which is helpful. However, if they're too big, they can push important content off-screen, especially when I'm skimming during short breaks. This sometimes means I have to scroll more, which eats into my limited reading time.

Slower loading times from big images can also be a pain if I'm trying to catch up quickly. Balancing image size to enhance but not overwhelm the article is key for my reading experience.

**Sabine (Homemaker):** How do large images impact your reading experience on news websites?

I find large images visually appealing and they draw me into celebrity stories, but they can sometimes overshadow the text.

Specific example of a large image helping or distracting:

A large photo of a celebrity at an event helped me quickly grasp the article's focus, but sometimes images distract me from reading if they're too eye-catching.

Do you notice any drawbacks with very large images?

Yes, sometimes large images push important text off-screen, and I have to scroll more, which can interrupt my reading flow.

Reaction:

I agree with Klaus that a balance is needed. Images should enhance without overwhelming. I enjoy the visual aspect but don't want to miss out on the main content.

**Thomas (Sports fan):** Large images can make sports articles more engaging by highlighting key moments, like a goal or race finish, but they shouldn't overshadow the text.

Once, a big image of a football match-winning goal helped me understand the article faster. However, too-large images can push text off-screen, making it harder to digest scores or stats quickly.

Like Klaus, I find it aggravating if they slow down loading times when I need updates fast. Images should enhance the content without causing distractions or delays. Balancing them is crucial for effective reading.

**Monika (Bargain hunter):** **My understanding:** How do large images affect your experience on news sites, and do they help or distract from articles?

**My answer:** Large images can be helpful for spotting deals and product visuals, but they can also distract from the details I'm looking for. For instance, a big image of a product can help me decide if it's worth a closer look, but if it's too large, it might push the price and details off-screen.

**Drawbacks:** Large images can indeed slow down my browsing, which is frustrating when I'm trying to quickly find offers. I agree with Klaus and Thomas that balance is needed so images add value without hindering access to important info.

**Jürgen (Traditional):** **My understanding:** How do large images affect your news reading, and are they helpful or distracting?

**My answer:** Large images can be distracting and push important content off-screen, which makes it harder to focus on the actual news.

**Specific example:** Recently, an article on crime had a huge image that overshadowed the accompanying details, making it harder to find the facts I was interested in.

**Drawbacks:** Yes, large images can slow down loading times. Like Klaus and Monika mentioned, balance is key. I prefer straightforward reporting without unnecessary visual distractions.

**Why:** I value quick access to critical information, and as a taxi driver with limited time, I need the text to be clear and direct.

**Facilitator:** Would smaller images improve page loading and overall user experience? Follow‑up: How much of a difference in loading speed do you currently notice with these large images, and what improvement would make a real impact for you? Follow‑up: How small could the images be before they lose the clarity or engagement you value?

**Klaus (Working class):** Smaller images might improve loading speed and user experience.

Currently, large images sometimes slow down the page, which can be frustrating during short breaks. Even a slight improvement in speed would help me stay updated more efficiently.

Images should remain clear and engaging; if they're too small, they lose value. As long as clarity is maintained, I'm open to smaller sizes.

Balancing speed and quality is key so I can quickly catch up during breaks without losing visual context.

**Sabine (Homemaker):** Would smaller images make Bild.de better for me?

Smaller images could speed things up, but I love big, clear pictures of celebrities. They make stories more engaging for me.

I don’t notice loading speed as much, maybe because I enjoy browsing leisurely. But if things could load faster without losing picture quality, that’d be nice. Images should stay large enough to show all the details I enjoy.

Klaus mentioned balancing speed and quality. I agree; images need to stay engaging but not slow things down too much, especially for those needing quick updates.

**Thomas (Sports fan):** I understand the question as whether making images smaller would improve page loading and user experience.

Smaller images could definitely improve loading speed, which is crucial for quick sports updates. Currently, large images slow things down, especially when I'm trying to get transfer news on the go. Reducing the size could make a real difference as long as the images remain clear enough to keep their engagement. 

I agree with Klaus that balancing speed and quality is important. I need a setup where I get my news quickly, without losing the visual impact that helps understand the context of sports highlights.

**Monika (Bargain hunter):** Smaller images might speed up loading and improve user experience.

Currently, large images can slow things down, which is annoying when I'm looking for quick deals and offers. Even a moderate boost in speed would make my shopping more efficient.

Images should be clear enough to see product details without taking too long to load. If they're too small, I might miss important information.

I agree with Klaus and Thomas about needing a balance between speed and quality. Fast-loading pages with clear product images help me make informed purchase decisions quickly.

**Jürgen (Traditional):** You're asking if smaller images could improve loading speed and user experience on Bild.de.

I believe smaller images might help load pages faster, which is useful, especially given my low tech-savviness. Currently, large images do slow things down, particularly on mobile. Improving speed would be beneficial, but images need to stay clear to convey important details.

Klaus, Thomas, and Monika all mentioned the need to balance speed and quality, which I agree is crucial. I value clarity, particularly in stories about crime and immigration, which need to be straightforward and impactful.

So, images can be smaller, but not at the expense of losing critical details. Balancing speed with the importance of clear, informative visuals is key for me.
