  - ✅ Fixed "Only one live display may be active at once" error in rich UI
  - ✅ Eliminated nested progress bars to prevent display conflicts
  - ✅ Updated UI utilities to share console instances
  - ✅ Verified all UI components working correctly with multi-market data
  - ✅ Successfully tested full workflow from data collection to analysis
  - ✅ Fixed import statements and f-string formatting with ruff
  - ✅ Applied code formatting with black
  - ✅ Updated test suite to work with typer command interface
  - ✅ Verified all tests passing after UI and code fixes

- **Phase 12: Code Quality Improvements (Sanity Check)**
  - ✅ Ran all unit tests and verified all passing
  - ✅ Fixed unused imports in pull_all_markets.py
  - ✅ Fixed unused variable (review_count_start) in pull_all_markets.py
  - ✅ Fixed f-string without placeholders in pull_all_markets.py
  - ✅ Applied black formatting to ensure consistent code style
  - ✅ Ran linter (ruff) to identify and address code quality issues
  - ✅ Verified all fixes with comprehensive test suite

- **Phase 13: Maintenance Tools**
  - ✅ Created cleanup utility script for data management
  - ✅ Implemented CLI arguments for dry run and keeping recent files
  - ✅ Added rich progress visualization for cleanup operations
  - ✅ Fixed all code quality issues in newly added maintenance tools
  - ✅ Ran sanity check to verify all tests pass after adding new tools

### Next Steps (Production Usage)
1. **Running the Analysis with Enhanced UI**
   - Execute `python pull_all_markets.py --android-app lounge` to collect reviews for Lounge app
   - Alternative: `python pull_all_markets.py 1597113 --days 90` for custom time period
   - After collection, run `python analyze_all_markets.py [generated_file_path]` to process
   - Review the generated reports in terminal and examine JSON output files
   - Use `python cleanup.py --dry-run` to preview data cleanup operations
   - Execute actual data cleanup with `python cleanup.py` or `python cleanup.py --keep-latest`

### Recent Fixes (Sanity Check - April 2025)
- ✅ Fixed test failures in appbot-client tests by improving test assertions:
  - Replaced brittle exact parameter order checks with flexible parameter checking
  - Added timeout parameter checks to ensure network timeouts are properly set
  - Made tests verify functionality rather than implementation details
- ✅ Fixed code style issues in appbot-client and test_client.py:
  - Applied black formatting to ensure consistent code style
  - Added comments for better code clarity in request handling
  - Improved error handling and timeout parameter handling
- ✅ Fixed code style issues in userboard4-baimuratov.py:
  - Corrected multiple imports on one line (import asyncio, os, json, sys)
  - Removed unused imports (Optional, Field)
  - Removed redundant json import
  - Fixed f-string without placeholders
- ✅ All tests now pass successfully
- ✅ Code formatting with black applied to edited files
- ✅ All linter checks pass with ruff


## Success Criteria
Our goal is to analyze app reviews using LLMs to extract feature requests and generate interview questions.

Final output should be a JSON file containing:
```json
[
  {
    "topic": "Feature request description",
    "core_questions": ["Question 1", "Question 2", "Question 3"],
    "max_followups": 3
  }
]
```
