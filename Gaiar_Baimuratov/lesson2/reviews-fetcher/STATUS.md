  - ✅ Added docstrings and type hints throughout the code

- **Phase 8: Multi-Market Analysis**
  - ✅ Created scripts for analyzing all markets (`pull_all_markets.py`, `analyze_all_markets.py`)
  - ✅ Added unit tests for multi-market analysis scripts

### Completed Tasks (continued)
- **Phase 9: Code Quality and Testing**
  - ✅ Enhanced unit tests for multi-market analysis
  - ✅ Added comprehensive test coverage (pagination, error handling, date ranges)
  - ✅ Fixed code formatting with black
  - ✅ Fixed linting issues with ruff
  - ✅ Verified all tests pass after code quality improvements

- **Phase 10: User Experience Enhancements**
  - ✅ Created rich UI framework with shared utilities
  - ✅ Added beautiful progress visualization with real-time tracking 
  - ✅ Enhanced data presentation with tables and statistics
  - ✅ Implemented detailed process tracking and timing
  - ✅ Added feature duplication detection and metrics
  - ✅ Integrated GPT-4o summary generation
  - ✅ Created comprehensive final reports with statistics
  - ✅ Added unit tests for UI components
  - ✅ Fixed linting and formatting for UI code

### Ready for Final Deployment
- The feature request analyzer is now complete and ready for production use
- It can analyze reviews from all markets and languages
- Supports full error handling and has comprehensive test coverage
- Features beautiful terminal UI with rich interactive elements

### Recent Bug Fixes
- **Phase 11: UI Fixes and Stability Improvements**
  - ✅ Fixed "Only one live display may be active at once" error in rich UI
  - ✅ Eliminated nested progress bars to prevent display conflicts
  - ✅ Updated UI utilities to share console instances
  - ✅ Verified all UI components working correctly with multi-market data
  - ✅ Successfully tested full workflow from data collection to analysis
  - ✅ Fixed import statements and f-string formatting with ruff
  - ✅ Applied code formatting with black
  - ✅ Updated test suite to work with typer command interface
  - ✅ Verified all tests passing after UI and code fixes

- **Phase 12: Code Quality Improvements (Sanity Check)**
  - ✅ Ran all unit tests and verified all passing
  - ✅ Fixed unused imports in pull_all_markets.py
  - ✅ Fixed unused variable (review_count_start) in pull_all_markets.py
  - ✅ Fixed f-string without placeholders in pull_all_markets.py
  - ✅ Applied black formatting to ensure consistent code style
  - ✅ Ran linter (ruff) to identify and address code quality issues
  - ✅ Verified all fixes with comprehensive test suite

### Next Steps (Production Usage)
1. **Running the Analysis with Enhanced UI**
   - Execute `python pull_all_markets.py --android-app lounge` to collect reviews for Lounge app
   - Alternative: `python pull_all_markets.py 1597113 --days 90` for custom time period
   - After collection, run `python analyze_all_markets.py [generated_file_path]` to process
   - Review the generated reports in terminal and examine JSON output files


## Success Criteria
Our goal is to analyze app reviews using LLMs to extract feature requests and generate interview questions.

Final output should be a JSON file containing:
```json
[
  {
    "topic": "Feature request description",
    "core_questions": ["Question 1", "Question 2", "Question 3"],
    "max_followups": 3
  }
]
```
