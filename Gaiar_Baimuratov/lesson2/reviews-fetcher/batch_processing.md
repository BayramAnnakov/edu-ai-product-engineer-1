# Batch Processing Plan: Integrating Review Analysis with UserBoard4

This implementation plan outlines the steps to create a processing pipeline that takes feature requests extracted from analyze_all_markets.py and feeds them into UserBoard4 to generate interview transcripts for each feature with personas from personas.csv.

## Phase 1: Setup and Infrastructure

- [x] **1.1 Create adapter module to convert between formats**
  - Create a new file `feature_adapter.py` that will convert the analyze_all_markets.py JSON output (list of feature dictionaries) into the format expected by UserBoard4 (dictionary with "features" key)

- [x] **1.2 Create configuration loader**
  - Implement a function to load and merge configuration settings from environment variables and config files
  - Support specifying the input file (features from analyze_all_markets), personas file, and output directory

- [x] **1.3 Implement batch processing executor**
  - Create a main batch processing script that will coordinate the execution of multiple interview sessions
  - Implement logging and progress tracking to monitor processing status

## Phase 2: Data Processing Components

- [ ] **2.1 Implement feature grouping and deduplication**
  - Create logic to group similar features to avoid redundant interviews
  - Implement NLP-based similarity detection to identify related feature requests
  - Add a threshold parameter to control grouping sensitivity

- [ ] **2.2 Create persona selection logic**
  - Implement criteria for selecting which personas should participate in which feature interviews
  - Support different persona subsets for different feature types (e.g., UI features, payment features)
  - Allow customizing the number of personas per interview

- [ ] **2.3 Design interview question customization**
  - Create a system to customize interview questions based on feature request characteristics
  - Implement context enrichment to make questions more specific and relevant

## Phase 3: Execution Engine

- [x] **3.1 Create parallel processing capability**
  - Implement asynchronous execution of multiple interviews to improve throughput
  - Add throttling controls to prevent API rate limiting
  - Include error handling and retry logic

- [x] **3.2 Implement interview session management**
  - Create a session manager to handle the lifecycle of each interview
  - Support saving intermediate results in case of interruption
  - Implement resumption of interrupted processing

- [x] **3.3 Build output management system**
  - Create standardized naming conventions for output files
  - Implement structured storage of interview transcripts, organized by feature category
  - Design a system to track relationships between feature requests and generated interviews

## Phase 4: Analysis and Reporting

- [x] **4.1 Implement cross-interview analysis**
  - Create logic to analyze patterns across multiple interview transcripts
  - Identify common themes, concerns, and sentiment patterns
  - Generate statistical insights on feature popularity and controversy levels

- [x] **4.2 Design consolidated reporting**
  - Create a report generator that summarizes findings across all interviews
  - Implement visual representation of results (charts, tables)
  - Support different report formats (markdown, HTML, PDF)

- [ ] **4.3 Build recommendation engine**
  - Implement a system to prioritize features based on interview results
  - Create logic to identify high-value, low-effort implementation opportunities
  - Generate implementation roadmap suggestions

## Phase 5: Integration and Optimization

- [x] **5.1 Create main entry point script**
  - Implement `process_all_features.py` as the primary entry point
  - Support command-line arguments for different execution modes
  - Include help documentation and examples

- [x] **5.2 Optimize for performance**
  - Implement caching of intermediate results
  - Add batching strategies to minimize API calls
  - Optimize memory usage for large datasets

- [x] **5.3 Add monitoring and diagnostics**
  - Implement detailed logging for troubleshooting
  - Create progress visualization
  - Add performance metrics collection

## Phase 6: Testing and Validation

- [ ] **6.1 Create unit tests**
  - Implement tests for each component
  - Create mock data for testing without API calls
  - Ensure test coverage for all core functionality

- [ ] **6.2 Perform end-to-end testing**
  - Test the complete pipeline with real data
  - Verify output quality and consistency
  - Validate performance with different dataset sizes

- [ ] **6.3 Conduct error handling validation**
  - Test behavior with malformed input
  - Verify graceful degradation under resource constraints
  - Test recovery from various failure modes

## Phase 7: Documentation and Deployment

- [ ] **7.1 Create comprehensive documentation**
  - Write detailed usage instructions
  - Document configuration options
  - Create troubleshooting guide

- [ ] **7.2 Prepare example configurations**
  - Create sample configuration files for common use cases
  - Document best practices and optimization strategies
  - Provide benchmark results and performance guidelines

- [ ] **7.3 Implement CI/CD integration**
  - Create scripts for automated testing
  - Implement version control hooks
  - Prepare for future continuous deployment
