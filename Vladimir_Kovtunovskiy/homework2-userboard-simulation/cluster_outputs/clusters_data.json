Though premium is pretty much required, and some smaller artists I can find on soundcloud/youtube/bandcamp aren't available on spotify, but most of what I listen is available. Trying with a trial of premium atm, considering starting to pay for it mainly because the sound quality is way better than other apps I use. Btw you need to set quality in settings for best quality.",
