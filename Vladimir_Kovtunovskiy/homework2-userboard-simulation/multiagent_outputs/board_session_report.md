If you would fix this little problem, I would give you that fifth star.

### 🎤 [Facilitator - Round 1]
Okay everyone, thanks for joining. We're looking at 3 potential new features for Spotify based on user feedback:
1. Introduce a more robust shuffle algorithm that allows users to exclude specific songs or genres from the shuffle mode
2. Enhance app stability on all devices by prioritizing bug fixes related to the player's responsiveness and visibility issues in notification bars
3. Implement a flexible skip feature for non-premium users, allowing them to earn additional skips through engagement with app features or advertisements

Let's go around once. Please give your initial, honest opinion on these features in 1-3 sentences, grounding it in your own experience. What's your gut reaction?

#### 👤 Ella Thompson
Regarding the first feature, improving the shuffle algorithm sounds fantastic. I've often found the current shuffle doesn't mix songs well, so having control over what gets included would be a huge improvement for me. As for the second feature, I haven't experienced many issues with app stability myself, but I can see how that would be beneficial for overall user experience. The third feature doesn't affect me directly as a Premium user, but I think it's a smart way to increase engagement from non-Premium users.

#### 👤 Ella Johnson
I think the second feature about enhancing app stability really hits home for me. I've had so many issues with the app freezing and the music pausing unexpectedly that any improvement in stability would greatly enhance my daily use of Spotify. The other features seem useful too, but honestly, fixing the existing bugs is far more critical for me.

#### 👤 Jason
Honestly, the second feature about enhancing app stability is crucial for me. I've been really frustrated with frequent crashes and unresponsiveness, especially when I'm trying to switch between songs or playlists. This improvement would significantly enhance my listening experience. The other features are interesting, but stability is my top priority.

#### 👤 Ella Harris
I think the second feature about enhancing app stability is crucial for me. I've been really frustrated with frequent crashes and unresponsiveness, especially when I'm trying to switch between songs or playlists. This improvement would significantly enhance my listening experience. The other features are interesting, but stability is my top priority.

#### 👤 Emma Johnson
For me, the third feature about implementing a flexible skip feature for non-premium users sounds the most appealing. Since I can't afford a premium subscription, the idea of earning more skips through engagement could really improve my listening experience, especially considering how often I encounter ads that disrupt the flow. On the other hand, the first feature about a robust shuffle algorithm is nice but less impactful for my daily use. Stability improvements in the second feature are always good, but not something I'm desperately needing right now.

### 🎤 [Facilitator - Round 2]
Thanks for those initial thoughts. Now, let's dig a bit deeper into these features:
1. Introduce a more robust shuffle algorithm that allows users to exclude specific songs or genres from the shuffle mode
2. Enhance app stability on all devices by prioritizing bug fixes related to the player's responsiveness and visibility issues in notification bars
3. Implement a flexible skip feature for non-premium users, allowing them to earn additional skips through engagement with app features or advertisements

*   Are there any potential downsides, implementation challenges, or things that worry you about them?
*   How well do you feel they address the core problems you (or users like you) face?
Please share your thoughts (1-3 sentences), building on what you've heard if relevant.

#### 👤 Ella Thompson
For the first feature, a more robust shuffle algorithm, my main concern is about its complexity. It could potentially become cumbersome to manage preferences if not implemented with a user-friendly interface. However, it directly addresses my frustration with the poor mixing of songs in the current shuffle mode, so if done well, it could significantly enhance my listening experience.

Enhancing app stability, as per the second feature, doesn't present many downsides to me, except perhaps the resource allocation that might slow down the rollout of other new features. But, it would greatly alleviate my irritation with random songs starting unexpectedly and other stability issues, making it a very worthwhile trade-off.

The third feature about a flexible skip doesn't affect me directly as a Premium user, but I can see potential issues with user engagement if the tasks required to earn skips are too time-consuming or not rewarding enough. It doesn't address any of my core problems, but it seems like a positive step for non-Premium user engagement.

#### 👤 Ella Johnson
For the second feature, about enhancing app stability, I see no real downside except maybe it might take a lot of resources to fix, which could delay other updates or features. This is crucial for me, as it directly addresses all the freezing and unexpected music pauses that disrupt my daily routine. If Spotify can really improve stability, it would make my experience so much better and less frustrating.

Regarding the first feature, while the idea of a more robust shuffle algorithm sounds good, I'm worried about how complicated it could become to use, especially if I have to manually exclude songs or genres frequently. It doesn't directly solve any of the core issues I face with the app's performance.

The third feature about flexible skips doesn't directly impact me since I'm a premium user, but I can see it potentially leading to users feeling forced to interact more with ads or other features just to listen to music smoothly, which might be annoying for them.

#### 👤 Jason
Regarding the second feature about enhancing app stability, there's a concern about how long it might take to see improvements. These bugs have been a consistent pain point in my experience with Spotify, disrupting my study sessions and leisure time. It's crucial that this issue is addressed swiftly and effectively because it affects the basic functionality of the app.

As for the first feature, the improved shuffle algorithm sounds beneficial, but I'm worried it could become another source of bugs or complications if not implemented carefully. It addresses a lesser issue compared to app stability, but it's still a welcome improvement.

The third feature, offering flexible skips for non-premium users, doesn't affect me directly as I use Premium. However, I can see potential downsides for non-premium users, such as increased annoyance if earning skips is too intrusive or time-consuming, which could detract from the overall user experience rather than enhance it.

Focus on making a choice for priority (1-3 sentences).

#### 👤 Ella Thompson
If Spotify could only implement one of these features soon, the most important for me would be enhancing app stability on all devices. The frequent crashes and unresponsiveness affect the core functionality of the app, making it frustrating to use, which directly impacts my daily experience. As for trade-offs, while the other features offer quality-of-life improvements, ensuring the app works smoothly and reliably should be the priority, as it lays the foundation for a better user experience overall.

#### 👤 Jason
If Spotify could only implement one of these features soon, the most important for me would definitely be the second one: enhancing app stability. The frequent crashes and other issues have been a major hindrance to my daily usage, especially when I rely on it so much for studying and leisure. Stability is foundational; without it, the other features lose some of their value because you can't enjoy them if the app isn’t running smoothly.

#### 👤 Emma Johnson
If Spotify could only implement one of these features, I would prioritize the third one, the flexible skip feature for non-premium users. This could significantly enhance the listening experience for those who, like me, find the frequent ads disruptive but can't afford a premium subscription. It would make using Spotify a lot more enjoyable and manageable on a tight budget.
